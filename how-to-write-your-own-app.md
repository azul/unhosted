* Start with apps/myfavouritesandwich.org/
* Change index.html and mfs.js to what you want to have
* The other files can stay the same. We described the function of each file in an [etherpad](https://unhosted.titanpad.com/documentation)

This is all still too much in flux to be a proper documented framework. For now, always make sure you come to our [chat room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=unhosted) whenever you work on an app, so we can all help each other, share the experience, and together form part of the revolution. If you are thinking about writing an app, then that means you are already one of us. Welcome!
